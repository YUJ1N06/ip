# UI Test Plan

The test runner compares stdout exactly, after normalizing CRLF line endings.
Compile the application first with Java 25:

```bash
javac -d /tmp/daddy-classes $(find src/main/java -name '*.java' ! -path '*/gui/*' ! -name 'Launcher.java')
```

## Manual test: JavaFX command conversation
Aim: Verify that the graphical interface sends the same commands to Daddy's existing command engine and presents
its responses cleanly.

Run `./gradlew run`, then enter `todo read book`, `mark 1`, `find book`, and `bye` in the command field.

The window should show each entered command on the right and Daddy's command responses on the left. The graphical
header should show compact white ASCII art without wrapping it and use the baby-pink theme. The greeting and
command responses should omit command-line-only divider lines. A plain `list` command should display a graphical
task panel with status, task type, description, and date details rather than console-style task text.
After `bye`, the command field and Send button should be disabled. Daddy Noel should appear as Daddy's large,
circularly cropped left-side profile avatar, while My Little Pony should appear as the user's large, circularly
cropped right-side profile avatar.

## Manual test: date and time parsing
Aim: Verify that deadlines and events parse ISO dates/times and display friendly values.

### Inputs

```text
deadline return book /by 02-12-2019 1800
event project meeting /from 02-12-2019 1400 /to 02-12-2019 1600
list
bye
```

Expected display includes `Dec 2 2019 18:00` for the deadline and
`Dec 2 2019 14:00` to `Dec 2 2019 16:00` for the event.

## Manual test: filter dated tasks
Aim: Verify that `list on dd-MM-yyyy` shows only deadlines and events occurring on that date.

Create a Todo, a Deadline, and an Event dated `02-12-2019`, then enter:

```text
list on 02-12-2019
```

The Todo should be excluded, while the matching Deadline and Event should be listed.

## Manual test: find the earliest free time
Aim: Verify that a valid free-time request shows the earliest weekday slot without changing the task list.

Enter `free 4h`. Daddy should show one four-hour slot between 09:00 and 18:00 on Monday to Friday. The slot
should begin no earlier than the current minute, and it should not overlap any event in the task list. Todos,
and deadlines should not affect the result, while completed events should still occupy their scheduled time.
Enter `list` afterward and verify that no tasks were added, removed, or modified.

## Manual test: corrupted data recovery
Aim: Verify that malformed records are reported and skipped while valid records still load.

Before starting the app, place these lines in `data/daddy.txt`:

```text
T|1|keep me
BROKEN
D|0|return book|2019-12-02T00:00
E|x|bad
```

Start the app and enter `list`. The console should report corrupted lines 2 and 4,
while listing `keep me` as done and `return book` as not done. The app should
remain usable and accept `bye` normally. It should also create
`data/daddy.txt.backup` containing the original file and
`data/daddy.txt.corrupt` containing the rejected records with line numbers.

## Manual test: legacy Duke data migration
Aim: Verify that saved tasks from the previous Duke file name are preserved.

Ensure `data/daddy.txt` does not exist, then place this line in `data/duke.txt`:

~~~text
T|1|keep me
~~~

Start the app and enter `list`. It should report that it moved the saved tasks to
`data/daddy.txt` and list `keep me` as done. Afterward, `data/daddy.txt` should
exist and `data/duke.txt` should no longer exist.

## Manual test: saved tasks load after restart
Aim: Verify that a task saved by one app session is restored by the next session.

In one session, enter:

```text
deadline return book /by 02-12-2019 1800
bye
```

Start the app again and enter `list`. The list should contain
`[D][ ] return book (by: Dec 2 2019 18:00)`.

## Test case: delete removes and renumbers tasks
Aim: Verify that deleting a valid task removes it and that the remaining tasks are renumbered.

### Command
java -cp /tmp/daddy-classes daddy.Daddy

### Input
todo keep me
todo remove me
delete 2
list
bye

     Daddy's workday runs from 09:00 to 18:00, so one free slot cannot exceed 9 hours.
    ____________________________________________________________
    ____________________________________________________________
     Here are the tasks in your list:
     1.[T][ ] buy milk
    ____________________________________________________________
    ____________________________________________________________
     'abc' is not a task number. Try mark 1, for example.

     A deadline needs a /by date or time. Try: deadline return book /by Sunday
    ____________________________________________________________
    ____________________________________________________________
